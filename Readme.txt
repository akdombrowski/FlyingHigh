FlyingHigh

This mod basically allows you to jump really high. You can leap over castle walls with one jump. Settings give access to jump acceleration, jump speed limit, and percentage of damage taken from a fall.

I can't guarantee you won't break the game with extreme numbers. Make sure you save before testing out different settings from default!

:: REQUIREMENTS ::

* MCM

:: FEATURES ::

* Customize your jump acceleration, jump speed limit, and fall damage.

:: GENERAL OTHER STUFF ::

* The default for percentage of damage taken from a fall is 100%. Same as vanilla.
* The default for jump acceleration is 4. Same as vanilla.
* The default for jump speed limit is 0. Same as vanilla.
